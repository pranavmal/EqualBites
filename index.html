    <h1 class="title">EqualBites - Detecting Food Deserts in the United States</h1>
    <div id="imgDescContainer">
        <p class="desc">Modern culture has created a generation of people whose lives revolve around convenience. With this comes several downsides, one of which being the creation of "fast food". Fast food is a massive industry that includes recognizable brands, like McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, and much more. These restaurants allow people to quickly pick up premade foods from the comfort of their car. These premade meals, however, have very little nutritious value, and are actually detrimental to people over a long period of time. Someone who is only living on fast food is guarenteed to live a much shorter life than someone who survives on more organic foods. People who live surrounded by quick-service restaurants such as this without many organic food sources are existing in an environment known as a "food desert".
        <br/> <br/> We've decided to step in and take action by creating the FoodTracker app. This application allows people to view a map of the USA, from which it is possible to zoom in on food deserts that exist around them, particularly in low-income neighbourhoods. Not only that, but it encourages people to take intiative by helping those around them. We don't just want people to be educated, we want them to be motivated, too. So, we've included tips for people seeking to help in their community and beyond, as well.
        <br/> <br/> Many see this new commodity culture as a normal occurence. Although it has made the everyday life easier in some ways, it is imperative that we also see the negatives, as well. Admitting that something needs to change is the first step to reform. So, with this, we hope we've encourage you to not only advocate for a change in this system, but take action and fight for it.</p>
